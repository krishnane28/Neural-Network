# Neural-Network
Neural Network implementation

This is the code for the neural network implementation

This neural network currently predicts the addition of two numbers

This neural network has two hidden layers which makes this a deep neural
network

This code can be used to create a neural network which can perform any
prediction task 

Input and target values must be provided accordingly during training and also
show mention the number of hidden layers for each prediction problem
